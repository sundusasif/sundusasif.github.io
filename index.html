				<h2><strong>WHO AM I</strong></h2>	
				<p>My name is Sundus Asif, and I'm a Graphic Designer based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I started off my education on a completely different path and soon realized that the world of art is my calling. The day I realized that was the day I fell in love. Since then design has been my world and I have never looked back. I enjoy challenges and thrive to always find the best solution. I have a growing knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign, Dreamweaver, as well as a bit of CSS and HTML. I also have a strong passion for all things typography and a fascination with print design of all sorts. You can view my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

			<h2>WHAT INSPIRES ME</h2>
			<p>The earth is absolutely, complete and utterfly the bestest planet in the whole universe. It is full of inspirations and beauty in every corner you look. Everything about life inspires me but what I love doing the most is simplifyin that beauty into a clear, concise message. When I design something I want the viewer to feel what I feel without having to dig through the chaos. I love simplicity. Clean cut and modern designs is what my brand is all about. I strongly believe that a picture is worth a thousand words and I make sure that my work speaks to your audience the way you would want to.</p>
